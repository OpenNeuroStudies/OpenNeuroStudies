  "Description": "This dataset consists of empirical ultra high-field fMRI data recorded at four spatial resolutions (0.8 mm, 1.4 mm, 2 mm, and 3 mm isotropic voxel size) for orientation decoding in visual cortex \u2014 in order to test hypotheses on the strength and spatial scale of orientation discriminating signals. This is an extension of the studyforrest project. All seven participants previously volunteered for the audio-only and the audio-visual Forrest Gump study. The dataset is compliant with the BIDS data description standard (http://bids.neuroimaging.io).  A detailed description can be found in: Sengupta, A., Yakupov, R., Speck, O., Pollmann, S., Hanke, M. Ultra High-Field (7 Tesla) multi-resolution fMRI data on the representation of visual orientation. Data in Brief (submitted) For more information about the project visit: http://studyforrest.org",
