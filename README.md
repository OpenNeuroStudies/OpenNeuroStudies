# OpenNeuroStudies

This is a [DataLad super-dataset](https://docs.datalad.org/en/stable/glossary.html#term-superdataset) to 

- bring together all datasets among [OpenNeuroDatasets](https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/),
  [OpenNeuroDerivatives](https://github.com/OpenNeuroDerivatives/), 
  and potentially other locations/resources into 
  [BIDS "study"](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common-principles.html#study-dataset) datasets.

- provide dashboards (overall, per study, per dataset, per subject/session) to overview
  the status and summarize across
  - bids-validation
  - potentially consistency of acquisition in the original raw dataset
  - mriqc
  - fmriprep
  - and other derivatives available for those datasets.


Remember that for viewing .tsv files locally you can use an awesome
[visidata](https://www.visidata.org/) tool.
