  "StudyDescription": "This dataset contains EEG and Eyetracker data collected from 21 participants while they performed a matrix-based cBCI task. The participants were asked to focus on target characters in a 6x6 matrix and their EEG and eye movements were recorded simultaneously. The dataset includes raw data for calibration and copy spelling tasks, as well as event markers indicating the presentation of target and non-target stimuli."
