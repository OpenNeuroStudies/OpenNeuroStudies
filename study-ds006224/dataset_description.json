  "Description": "27 participants were selected from the PPMI dataset. These data are found within the folder 'BIDS'. Within 'BIDS' are each participant's folders containing their respective MRI data. Within each of these participant folders are three sessions corresponding to Visits 1, 2, and 3 that are discussed in the manuscript. In this regard, 'ses-01' corresponds to 'Visit 1', 'ses-02' corresponds to 'Visit 2', and 'ses-03' corresponds to 'Visit 3'. Within each 'ses-' folder are 'anat' and 'func' folders containing respective MRI data in .nii format. Raw DICOMs from the PPMI database were converted to NIFTI using MRIcroGL.",
