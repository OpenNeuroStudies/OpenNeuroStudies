  "Name": "Developmental changes in brain function underlying the influence of reward processing on inhibitory control (Slot Reward)",
  "Description": "Adolescence is a period marked by changes in motivational and cognitive brain systems. However, the development of the interactions between reward and cognitive control processing are just beginning to be understood. Using event-related functional neuroimaging and an incentive modulated antisaccade task, we compared blood-oxygen level dependent activity underlying motivated response inhibition in children, adolescents, and adults.",
