  "BIDSVersion": "1.10.1",
  "Description": "This study examined incidental learning of probabilistic contingencies between spatial locations and object identities. On each trial, participants were presented with one of four possible colourful shapes, and were required to identify the target via button-press as quickly and accurately as possible. The target could appear in one of four locations - one in each of the four quadrants of the visual field. Each location was associated with one shape that appeared there frequently and one shape that appeared there infrequently; a second location was associated with the same targets, but with the opposite contingency mapping. Each trial had a single target that was thus either likely at the cued location (Frequent target condition), or unlikely at the cued location (Infrequent target condition).",
