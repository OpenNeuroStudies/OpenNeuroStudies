This work was performed, in part, at the San Diego Nanotechnology Infrastructure (SDNI) of UCSD, a member of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure, which is supported by the NSF (grant ECCS1542148). We thank Yangling Chou, Aaron Tripp, Fausto Minidio, Daniel J. Soper, and Alexandra O\u2019Donnell for their help in collecting the data. ",
  "HowToAcknowledge": "This project contains the data for the publication Lee et al, \"Flexible, Scalable, High Channel Count Stereo-Electrode for Recording in the Human Brain\". It contains the raw and preprocessed (epoched) intracranial EEG (iEEG) data files for multiple species to test novel high resolution micro-stereo-electrodes for recording neural activity in the brain. The data set involves the use of direct electrical stimulation to examine effects of stimulation in the brain. Contact: Shadi Dayeh (sdayeh@eng.ucsd.edu) or Angelique C. Paulk (apaulk@mgh.harvard.edu).

    "All patients voluntarily participated after fully informed consent as monitored by the Partners Institutional Review Board covering Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Participants were informed that participation in the stimulation tests would not alter their clinical treatment in any way, and that they could withdraw at any time without jeopardizing their clinical care. All rodent and pig experiments were approved by the UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol # S19030). For NHPs, all efforts were made to minimize discomfort, and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Massachusetts General Hospital monitored care and approved all procedures. "
